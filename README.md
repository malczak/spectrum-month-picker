This package is and extension to react-spectrum.

Unfortunately react-spectrum is not ready for adding custom date components and most of the components are hidden from library users.

This component relays heavily on hardcoded react-spectrum classes (eq. for making fields disabled). Class names were extracted from react-spectrum in version `3.23.0`.
